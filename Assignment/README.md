Lab 0: Introduction to C and Git
By: Chris Amling

‚Äùmath.c" was created to be a calculator program. Using the format and operations from Math.h, I was able to build the Math.c file.

Functionality:
The user can perform many different mathematical operations by entering two numbers (num1 and num2), and then an operation they would like completed. 

Mathematical Operations are:
* Addition: +
* Subtraction: -
* Multiplication: *
* Division: /
* Modulus: %
* Shift left: <
* Shift right: >
* Bitwise AND: &
* Bitwise OR: |
* Bitwise XOR: ^
* Bitwise inverse: ~

Examples:
int math(int 2, int 4, char +); Return: 6
int math(int 8, int 5, char *); Return: 40
